# React-Select-Multi-Async
Uses React-Select dropdowns so you can merge multiple async in one collection.
<br>
<br>
With the collection function, you will be able to consolidate all the init to one single JS.
<br>
<br>
I have included a test JS file with some generic logic that includes, but not limited to: 
<ul>
  <li>Server Side Calls</li>
    <li>Role handling</li>
    <li>Server Side Calls</li>
    <li>Form submission</li>
      <li>Custom filtering</li>
  </ul>
